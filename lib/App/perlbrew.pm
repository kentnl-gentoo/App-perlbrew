=head1 NAME

App::perlbrew - Manage perl installations in your $HOME

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Initialize
    perlbrew init

    # Install some Perls
    perlbrew install perl-5.8.1
    perlbrew install perl-5.11.5

    # See what were installed
    perlbrew installed

    # Switch perl in the $PATH
    perlbrew switch perl-5.11.5
    perl -v

    # Switch to another version
    perlbrew switch perl-5.8.1
    perl -v

    # Switch to a certain perl executable not managed by perlbrew.
    perlbrew switch /usr/bin/perl

    # Or turn it off completely. Useful when you messed up too deep.
    perlbrew off

    # Use 'switch' command to turn it back on.
    perlbrew switch perl-5.11.5

=head1 DESCRIPTION

perlbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of
perl in the users HOME. At the moment, it installs everything to
C<~/perl5/perlbrew>, and requires you to tweak your PATH by including a
bashrc/cshrc file it provides. You then can benefit from not having
to run 'sudo' commands to install cpan modules because those are
installed inside your HOME too. It's almost like an isolated perl
environments.

=head1 INSTALLATION

The recommended way to install perlbrew is to run these statements in
your shell:

    curl -LO http://xrl.us/perlbrew
    chmod +x perlbrew
    ./perlbrew install

After that, C<perlbrew> installs itself to C<~/perl5/perlbrew/bin>,
and you should follow the instruction on screen to setup your
C<.bashrc> or C<.cshrc> to put it in your PATH.

The downloaded perlbrew is a self-contained standalone program that
embed all non-core modules it uses. It should be runnable with perl
5.8 or high versions of perls.

You may also install perlbrew from CPAN with cpan / cpanp / cpanm:

    cpan App::perlbrew

This installs 'perlbrew' into your current PATH and it is always
executed with your current perl.

=head1 USAGE

Please read the program usage by running

    perlbrew

(No arguments.) To read a more detail one:

    perlbrew -h

Alternatively, this should also do:

    perldoc perlbrew

If you messed up to much or get confused by having to many perls
installed, you can do:

    perlbrew switch /usr/bin/perl

It will make sure that your current perl in the PATH is pointing
to C</usr/bin/perl>.

As a matter of fact the C<switch> command checks whether the given
argument is an executale or not, and create a symlink named 'perl' to
it if it is. If you really want to you are able to do:

    perlbrew switch /usr/bin/perl6

But maybe not. After running this you might not be able to run
perlbrew anymore. So be careful not making mistakes there.
