=head1 COMMANDS

=over 4

=item B<init>

Run this once to setup the C<perlbrew> directory ready for installing
perls into. Run it again if you decide to change C<PERLBREW_ROOT>.

=item B<mirror>

Run this if you want to choose a specific CPAN mirror to install the
perls from. It will display a list of mirrors for you to pick
from. Hit 'q' to cancel the selection.

=item B<install> perl-<version>

Build and install the given version of perl.

=item B<install> /path/to/perl/git/checkout/dir

Build and install from the given git checkout dir.

=item B<installed>

List the installed versions of perl.

=item B<use> perl-<version>

Notice: this only works in bash and zsh.

Switch to the given version of perl only in the current shell. This
will not effect newly opened shells.

=item B<switch> perl-<version>

Switch to the given version. You may need to run 'rehash' (or 'hash
-r') after this command.

=item B<version>

Show the version of perbrew.

=item B<off>

Disable perlbrew. Use C<switch> command to re-enable it.

=item B<env>

Low-level command. Use this command to see the list of environment
variables that are set by C<perlbrew> itself for bash integration.

The output is something similar to this:

    export PERLBREW_ROOT=/Users/gugod/perl5/perlbrew
    export PERLBREW_VERSION=0.11
    export PERLBREW_PATH=/Users/gugod/perl5/perlbrew/bin

=item B<symlink_executables> <perl-version>

Low-level command. Use this command to create the C<perl> executable
symbolic link to C<perl5.13.5>.

You don't need to do this unless you were using old perlbrew to
install perls. The installation layout is changed since version 0.11.

If you just upgraded perlbrew and found C<perlbrew switch> failed to work
after you switch to a development release of perl, say, perl-5.13.5, run this command:

    perlbrew symlink_executables perl-5.13.5

This essentially creates this symlink:

   ${PERLBREW_ROOT}/perls/perl-5.13.5/bin/perl
   -> ${PERLBREW_ROOT}/perls/perl-5.13.5/bin/perl5.13.5

You should not need to do this if you are using perlbrew 0.11 or newer, to intsall
