NAME
    App::perlbrew - Manage perl installations in your $HOME

SYNOPSIS
        # Initialize
        perlbrew init

        # pick a prefered CPAN mirror
        perlbrew mirror

        # Install some Perls
        perlbrew install perl-5.12.2
        perlbrew install perl-5.8.1
        perlbrew install perl-5.13.6

        # See what were installed
        perlbrew list

        # Switch perl in the $PATH
        perlbrew switch perl-5.12.2
        perl -v

        # Switch to another version
        perlbrew switch perl-5.8.1
        perl -v

        # Switch to a certain perl executable not managed by perlbrew.
        perlbrew switch /usr/bin/perl

        # Or turn it off completely. Useful when you messed up too deep.
        perlbrew off

        # Use 'switch' command to turn it back on.
        perlbrew switch perl-5.12.2

DESCRIPTION
    perlbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of perl
    in the users HOME. At the moment, it installs everything to
    "~/perl5/perlbrew", and requires you to tweak your PATH by including a
    bashrc/cshrc file it provides. You then can benefit from not having to
    run 'sudo' commands to install cpan modules because those are installed
    inside your HOME too. It's a completely separate perl environment.

INSTALLATION
    To use "perlbrew", it is required to install "curl" or "wget" first.
    "perlbrew" depends on one of this two external commmands to be there in
    order to fetch files from the internet.

    The recommended way to install perlbrew is to run these statements in
    your shell:

        curl -LO http://xrl.us/perlbrew
        chmod +x perlbrew
        ./perlbrew install

    or more simply:

        curl -L http://xrl.us/perlbrewinstall | bash

    After that, "perlbrew" installs itself to "~/perl5/perlbrew/bin", and
    you should follow the instruction on screen to setup your ".bashrc" or
    ".cshrc" to put it in your PATH.

    The directory "~/perl5/perlbrew" will contain all install perl
    executables, libraries, documentations, lib, site_libs. If you need to
    install "perlbrew", and the perls it brews, into somewhere else because,
    say, your HOME has limited quota, you can do that by setting a
    "PERLBREW_ROOT" environment variable before you run "./perlbrew
    install".

        export PERLBREW_ROOT=/mnt/perlbrew
        ./perlbrew install

    The downloaded perlbrew is a self-contained standalone program that
    embeds all non-core modules it uses. It should be runnable with perl 5.8
    or later versions of perl.

    You may also install perlbrew from CPAN with cpan / cpanp / cpanm:

        cpan App::perlbrew

    This installs 'perlbrew' into your current PATH and it is always
    executed with your current perl.

    NOTICE. When you install or upgrade perlbrew with cpan / cpanp / cpanm,
    make sure you are not using one of the perls brewed with perlbrew. If
    so, the `perlbrew` executable you just installed will not be available
    after you switch to other perls. You might not be able to invoke further
    "perlbrew" commands after so because the executable "perlbrew" is not in
    your "PATH" anymore. Installing it again with cpan can temporarily solve
    this problem. To ensure you are not using a perlbrewed perl, run
    "perlbrew off" before upgrading.

    It should be relatively safe to install "App::perlbrew" with system cpan
    (like "/usr/bin/cpan") because then it will be installed under a system
    PATH like "/usr/bin", which is not affected by "perlbrew switch"
    command.

    Again, it is recommended to let "perlbrew" install itself. It's easier,
    and it works better.
