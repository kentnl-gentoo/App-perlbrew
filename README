DESCRIPTION
    perlbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of perl
    in the users HOME. At the moment, it installs everything to
    "~/perl5/perlbrew", and requires you to tweak your PATH by including a
    bashrc/cshrc file it provides. You then can benefit from not having to
    run 'sudo' commands to install cpan modules because those are installed
    inside your HOME too. It's almost like an isolated perl environments.

INSTALLATION
    The recommended way to install perlbrew is to run these statements in
    your shell:

        curl -LO http://xrl.us/perlbrew
        chmod +x perlbrew
        ./perlbrew install

    After that, "perlbrew" installs itself to "~/perl5/perlbrew/bin", and
    you should follow the instruction on screen to setup your ".bashrc" or
    ".cshrc" to put it in your PATH.

    The downloaded perlbrew is a self-contained standalone program that
    embed all non-core modules it uses. It should be runnable with perl 5.8
    or high versions of perls.

    You may also install perlbrew from CPAN with cpan / cpanp / cpanm:

        cpan App::perlbrew

    This installs 'perlbrew' into your current PATH and it is always
    executed with your current perl.

USAGE
    Please read the program usage by running

        perlbrew

    (No arguments.) To read a more detail one:

        perlbrew -h

    Alternatively, this should also do:

        perldoc perlbrew

    If you messed up to much or get confused by having to many perls
    installed, you can do:

        perlbrew switch /usr/bin/perl

    It will make sure that your current perl in the PATH is pointing to
    "/usr/bin/perl".

    As a matter of fact the "switch" command checks whether the given
    argument is an executale or not, and create a symlink named 'perl' to it
    if it is. If you really want to you are able to do:

        perlbrew switch /usr/bin/perl6

    But maybe not. After running this you might not be able to run perlbrew
    anymore. So be careful not making mistakes there.
